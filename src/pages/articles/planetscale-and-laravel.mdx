[PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com)  is a neat MySQL-compatible serverless database that seems to work really nicely with Laravel.

Here are a few things I ran in to while setting up a recent project.


## .env

The `MYSQL_ATTR_SSL_CA` .env variable in the connection instructions for a Laravel app work well on my local machine running [Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/valet).

To get it working on a [Forge](https://forge.laravel.com)-provisioned production server, I used:

`MYSQL_ATTR_SSL_CA=/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`


## Promoting to Production

When attempting to promote my PlanetScale branch database to production, I ran into this:

`Table “password_resets” has no unique key: all tables must have at least one unique, not-null key.`

Since this is a new project, I just updated my `password_resets` migration by adding `$table->id();`

```PHP
Schema::create('password_resets', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->id();
    $table->string('email')->index();
    $table->string('token');
    $table->timestamp('created_at')->nullable();
});
```

## The workflow

Make sure you understand the concepts of [the PlanetScale workflow](https://planetscale.com/docs/concepts/planetscale-workflow). Also review the [Laravel-specific stuff](https://planetscale.com/blog/zero-downtime-laravel-migrations) - it's super helpful.

### Do not run migrations on your production server

> Just to recap, **you can still use Laravel migrations to modify your schema, but you should only run them on your application's dev environment**. Your dev environment will be connected to your PlanetScale development branch, so the migrations will run on your PlanetScale development database and can be safely merged into production when ready.

> **Do not run them on your production server.** Your production server is connected to your main production PlanetScale database, so PlanetScale is already handling it for you when you deploy your PS dev branch to production.

On Forge, I removed this in my deploy script:

```BASH
if [ -f artisan ]; then
    $FORGE_PHP artisan migrate --force
fi
```
